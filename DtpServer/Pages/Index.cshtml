            <p>With the introduction of the World Wide Web, the possibility for everybody to produce content that could potentially reach anyone else became possible. However, one crucial element was digitally left behind - Trust. The reputation of a few persons is easily managed, however for an individual to maintain the status of a vast number of only loosely known people, becomes an exhausting task. Relying on friends and family’s trust network is a way to solve this, but usually, they are not available at the time or do not even have the same interest sphere. Further, the possibility to be anonymous and still provide content make it hard for the reader to verify if the message is authentic.</p>
            <p>The Digital Trust Protocol (DTP) is a protocol for the handling of trust in the digital space. The protocol is broadly designed to work with all aspects of trust; this includes identity, reputation, and security.</p>
