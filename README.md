# DtpSolution
Server side solution with web server and core libraries, dependen on IPFS/go. Written in .Net Core C# 2.1

*Description*
The Protocol allows anyone, including automated software, to issue their own cryptographic identities, for the use of trust and reputation and be able to verify those of others, without the need for a trusted third party. Users issue claims to other identities, and this way build a personal web of trust network.
